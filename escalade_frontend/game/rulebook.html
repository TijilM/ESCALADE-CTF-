                <li>It is a 2-day event. The competition starts on 15 July and ends on 16 July.</li>
                <li>It is an intra-college event. Your team should consist of 2-3 members.</li>
                <li>All participants must join from a laptop.</li>
                <li>Each team starts with a fixed amount of points (50 points)</li>
                <li>Your team will be registered only if you have used your thapar email-id.</li>
                <li>All the participants are required to join the Escalade DISCORD server (<a href="https://discord.gg/DGzTnYUHBFKindly">https://discord.gg/DGzTnYUHBFKindly</a>) ensure that you have changed the discord username to your real name.</li>
                <li>Answer the first question to unlock the dice.</li>
                <li>
                    Roll the dice to get a number from 1 to 6.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Answering the question correctly will make you move forward the number of spaces shown on the dice. After this, you get access to the dice again and the process repeats.</li>
                        <li>If you land on a booster, you'll move forward a certain number of positions.</li>
                        <li>If you land on an opposer, you'll move back a certain number of positions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Answering the question correctly will land you 10 points.</li>
                <li>
                    On rolling the dice, you'll have three options before you:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Re-Roll: You get to roll the dice again. This will cost you 15 points.</li>
                        <li>Sneak-Peek: Take a glimpse of the position you'll reach after moving forward the number of spaces shown on the dice. This would help you make sure if there's a booster or opposer coming your way. This would cost you 25 points.</li>
                        <li>Note that you could take unlimited re-rolls and sneak peeks depending upon your points.</li>
                        <li>Continue: Press this if you are happy with the number received on the dice. This would take you to the question that needs to be answered.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Answering the question correctly will land you 10 points.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Answering the question correctly will make you move forward with the number of spaces shown on the dice. After this, you get access to the dice again and the process repeats.</li>
                        <li>If you land on a booster, you'll move forward a certain number of positions.</li>
                        <li>If you land on an opposer, you'll move back a certain number of positions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>You can take 1 hint per question. This will cost you 10 points.</li>
                <li>The team which first reaches the end would be declared the winner.</li>
                <li>In case of a Tie, the team having higher points would be declared the winner.</li>
                <li>In case of any discrepancy, the decision of the organizing team is final and binding.</li>
